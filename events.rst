Event Handling
==============

Listening for events
--------------------

You can attach event handlers to DOM elements:

.. code-block:: kotlin

    doc.body {
        val label = h1()
        label.text("Click Me")
        label.on.click {
            label.text("Clicked!")
        }
    }

Most if not all JavaScript event types are supported, and you can read event data like which key was pressed:

.. code-block:: kotlin

    doc.body {
        val input = input(type = text)
        input.on.keypress { keypressEvent ->
            println("Key Pressed: ${keypressEvent.key}")
        }
    }

Immediate events
----------------

Since the code to respond to events runs on the server, there may be a short lag between the action causing the
event and any changes to the DOM caused by the event handler.  This was a common complaint about previous server-driven
web frameworks like Vaadin, inhibiting their adoption.

Fortunately, Kweb has a solution:

.. code-block:: kotlin

    doc.body {
        val label = h1()
        label.text("Click Me")
        label.onImmediate.click {
            label.text("Clicked!")
        }
    }

This is identical to the first event listener example, except *on* has been replaced by *onImmediate*.

Kweb executes this event handler *on page render* and records the changes it makes to the DOM.  It then "pre-loads"
these instructions to the browser such that they are executed immediately when the event occurs without any server
round-trip.

.. warning:: Due to this pre-loading mechanism, the event handler for an *onImmediate* must limit itself to simple DOM modifications.  Kweb includes some runtime safeguards against this but they can't catch every problem so please use with caution.

Combination event handlers
--------------------------

A common pattern is to use both types of event handler on a DOM element.  The immediate handler might disable a clicked
button, or temporarily display some form of `spinner <https://loading.io/css/>`_.  The normal handler would then do
what it needs on the server, and then perhaps re-enable the button and remove the spinner.
